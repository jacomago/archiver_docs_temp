1.  <div>

    Why another archiver?

    </div>

    <div>

    Archiving millions of PVS requires a few additional features. In
    addition to focusing on the EPICS side of the equation, we also need
    to address the various IT aspects like flexibility, scriptability,
    policy enforcement etc. A integrated multi-head, multi-stage
    solution was called for; hence the appliance.

    </div>

2.  <div>

    What are the various configuration items?

    </div>

    <div>

    The various aspects of configuration are separated logically.
      Environment variable             Description                                                                                                                                                                                   Default
      -------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
      `ARCHAPPL_APPLIANCES`            This is mandatory and points to a file containing the list of appliances in this cluster. This must be identical across all members in the cluster.                                           `appliances.xml`
      `ARCHAPPL_POLICIES`              This contains the full path name of your policies file. The policies file is a python script that controls the parameters for archiving.                                                      `policies.py` in `WEB/classes`
      `ARCHAPPL_PROPERTIES_FILENAME`   This contains the full path name of `archappl.properties` file. The `archappl.properties` is the misc bucket for configuration and is a Java properties file with various name/value pairs.   `archappl.properties` in `WEB/classes`
      `ARCHAPPL_MYIDENTITY`            This contains the identity of this appliance; of course, this is different for each appliance. The appliance identity needs to match the identity as defined in the `appliances.xml`          `getCanonicalHostName()` in `InetAddress.getLocalHost()`

    In addition to this, the configuration for each PV is stored in the
    `PVTypeInfo` table in the MySQL configuration database specific to
    each appliance. The connection pool for the database is typically
    configured in Tomcat\'s `conf/context.xml`.

    </div>

3.  <div>

    Where are the logs?

    </div>

    <div>

    Most deployment have four tomcat containers per appliance - one each
    for the engine, ETL, retrieval and mgmt components. All the logs
    typically are sent to `arch.log` or similar files in the
    `CATALINA_HOME/logs` of these containers. Log levels are typically
    controlled using a `log4j2.xml` file in the `TOMCAT_HOME/lib` folder
    of these containers.

    </div>

4.  <div>

    What\'s the difference between SCAN and MONITOR?

    </div>

    <div>

    These are minor variations of the similar concepts in the
    ChannelArchiver and other archivers. Both SCAN and MONITOR use
    camonitors.
    -   For MONITOR, we estimate the number of samples based the PV\'s
        sampling period, allocate a buffer to accommodate this many
        samples and fill it up. The buffer\'s capacity is computed using
        something like so (see `ArchiveEngine.java:addChannel`)

            int buffer_capacity = ((int) Math.round(Math.max((write_period/pvSamplingPeriod)*sampleBufferCapacityAdjustment, 1.0))) + 1;

        -   pvSamplingPeriod is the sampling_period from the PV\'s
            PVTypeInfo
        -   write_period is the engine\'s write period from
            archappl.properties ( where it\'s called secondsToBuffer ) ;
            this defaults to 10 seconds.
        -   sampleBufferCapacityAdjustment is a system-wide adjustment
            for the buffer side and is set in archappl.properties.

        For example, if the `write_period` is 10 seconds, and the
        `pvSamplingPeriod` is 1 second, we would allocate
        `10/1 + 1 = 11` samples for the default
        `sampleBufferCapacityAdjustment`. Thus, in the case where the PV
        is changing at a rate greater than 1Hz, you should expect 11
        samples, a gap where we run out of space and throw away samples,
        then 11 samples when we switch buffers and so on. For example,
        here\'s a 10Hz PV being MONITOR\'ed at 1 second.

    -   For SCAN, the engine updates one slot/variable at whatever rate
        is sent from the IOC. And then a separate thread periodically
        picks the value of this one slot/variable every
        `pvSamplingPeriod` seconds and writes it out to the buffers.
        Here\'s a 10Hz PV being SCAN\'ed at 1 second.

    How are timezones handled?

    </div>

    <div>

    EPICS IOC\'s use UTC as their timezone. The EPICS Archiver Appliance
    also uses UTC for data storage and retrieval; that is, data is
    received, stored and retrieved as UTC timestamps. Conversion to
    local time zones are to be done at the client/viewer. The various
    viewers handle the transition into and out of daylight savings
    appropriately. For example, in this case, there are two `01:00`
    blocks on the x-axis to handle the extra hour inserted when daylight
    savings comes to an end at 01:00 on Nov/1/2015.

    </div>

    ![](images/ArchiveViewer_daylight_fall.png)

6.  <div>

    How are EPICS aliases supported?

    </div>

    <div>

    When adding a PV with an alias to the archiver, the archiver uses
    the `NAME/NAME$` fields of the PV to determine the *real* name. The
    PV is then archived under the *real* name and an entry is added to
    the `PVAliases` table with the alias name. Data retrieval and
    management are then supported under both names.

    For aliased PV\'s, the PVDetails of the PV should an a line
    indicating that this PV is an alias for the *real* PV.

    Also, in the mgmt webapp\'s arch.log, there should be an entry
    indicating this like so *Aborting archive request for pv
    ABC:DEF:ALIAS Reason: Aborting this pv ABC:DEF:ALIAS (which is an
    alias) and using the real name ABC:DEF:REAL instead.*
